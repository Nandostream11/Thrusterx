Robo-Kabaddi is a mobile robot 2-payer game played like Kabaddi. Each participant's side has four or more blocks kept in squares. Each participant gets a chance to raid the opposing side alternately. The raider has to get a block between its static clamps and take it to its side, while the defender has to either get it to lose the block before crossing the borderline or push it outside the ring.
Components used in this project:
ESP32 x2, 
Joystick modulex2, 
Chassis for RoboKabaddi, 
1000rpm DC motor x4,
