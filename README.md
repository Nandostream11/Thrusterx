# Joypad-controlled Thrusterx Robot

- Tested various ESP32 communication modes and selected the ESP-Now protocol for sending and receiving joystick command data over 120m from a remote.
- It can also be used for exploration of contaminated/nuclear zones and ecological data collection without direct human intervention.

## Thrusterx Bot model 
Robo-Kabaddi is a mobile robot 2-payer game played like Kabaddi. Each participant's side has four or more blocks kept in squares. Each participant gets a chance to raid the opposing side alternately. The raider has to get a block between its static clamps and take it to its side, while the defender has to either get it to lose the block before crossing the borderline or push it outside the ring.

### Components used in this project:
- ESP32 x2, 
- Joystick module x1, 
- Chassis and Wheels for RoboKabaddi model, 
- 1000rpm BLDC motor x4,
- L293D Motor Driver x1
